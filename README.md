# Amazon-Product-Analysis-using-AWS-Redshift
This project focuses on performing data analysis on Amazon India product listings using AWS 
services, primarily Amazon Redshift and AWS Glue. A cleaned dataset containing detailed product 
information such as title, price, rating, and bestseller status was loaded into Redshift from an S3 
bucket. Various SQL queries were executed to gain insights into product trends, including filtering 
products based on ratings, identifying bestsellers, and analyzing price distributions. Visualizations 
were created using Redshiftâ€™s built-in charting tools to interpret results more effectively. This 
project demonstrates practical use of ETL workflows and cloud-based data warehousing for large
scale e-commerce data analysis.
